CC Fraud Detection using ML Modeling

Used AdaBoost and Isolation Forest Models.
Used various feature tuning and hyperparameter tuning to get the best results for recall score on the test data.
Tried using TableVectorizer on Adaboost and Isolation Forest (code not provided). It helped Adaboost get better
test results but dropped isolation forest performance to 0. After retrieving feature importance on this vectorized
data, adaboost had better performance than non vectorized, but isolation forest had neglible performance increase 
compared to non vectorized data. Therefore, the results for vectorized data is not provided.
